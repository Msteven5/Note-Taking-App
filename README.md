This application is a note taking app that keeps your notes stored in the server to allow ease of reminders and allows a user to see what is stored easily.

## Installation

For this application to work as intended, you will need to clone the repository from GitHub, as well as download the Express node package using the "npm i Express" command in the terminal.

## Usage

This application can be used as a simple task reminder page that can be accessed easily and keeps the functionality simple.

## Contributing

I, Michael Davidson am the only one that contributed to this code besides the starter code that was provided by UTA via the bootcamp I am attending during the time of this application's creation.

## Tests

Run the application in the Terminal/CLI after having NODE and the dependencies listed in "installation" installed, to run the application and have access to saved notes and a note keeper.
